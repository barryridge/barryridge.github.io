I am a postdoctoral researcher working at [prof. dr. Aleš Ude's](https://www.ijs.si/~aude) [Humanoid and Cognitive Robotics Lab](http://www-hcr.ijs.si/) at the [Department of Automatics, Biocybernetics and Robotics](http://abr.ijs.si), [Jožef Stefan Institute](https://www.ijs.si/ijsw/V001/JSI), Ljubljana, Slovenia.
My research interests lie broadly in the fields of cognitive and developmental robotics where I mainly have experience in computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as in robot control system design and integration.

<!--
More specifically, by virtue of my Ph.D. studies, I have expertise in the area of *affordance learning*.  The concept of an *affordance* was originally conceived by the psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1970's, and loosely refers to idea that the environment, or particularly objects in the environment, offer or *afford* action possibilities to the organisms or agents residing in that environment.  My interest here is grounded both in the scientific question of how affordances come to be learned by humans and animals, as well as in the applied engineering question of how they might be learned and exploited by autonomous robots.  In pursuit of the latter goal, my active areas of research include 3D perception for manipulation, where I make frequent use of the [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/), as well as neural networks, and more recently deep learning methods.

I am currently employed on the [EU Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) [ReconCell](http://www.reconcell.eu/) project, which addresses the design and construction of rapidly reconfigurable robotic workcells for use by SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) .  Over the years, I have had the good fortune to work on a number of other exciting projects, including the [EU ICT project](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/) [ACat](http://www.acat-project.eu/), the [EU FP7 projects](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html) [Xperience](http://xperience.org/) and [CogX](http://www.vicos.si/Projects/CogX), and the [EU FP6 project](https://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm) [VISIONTRAIN](https://team.inria.fr/perception/projects/visiontrain/) from which I received my [Marie-Curie Fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) in order to pursue my Ph.D. studies.

Prior to coming to Slovenia, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Applications from the [School of Computing](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/) at [Dublin City University](http://www.dcu.ie/) in Ireland, before completing an M.Phil. in Pure Mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/maths/) at the [University of St. Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland.  I defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Learning Basic Object Affordances in a Robotic System" in 2014 under the supervision of [prof. dr. Aleš Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/) and [doc. dr. Danijel Skočaj](http://www.vicos.si/People/Danijels) at the [Visual Cognitive Systems Laboratory](http://www.vicos.si/Main_Page), [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en), [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/eng/), Slovenia.
