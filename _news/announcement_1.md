My paper entitled "Action-Grounded Surface Geometry and Volumetric Shape Feature Representations for Object Affordance Prediction" has been accepted for publication at [Humanoids 2016](http://www.humanoids2016.org).

The abstract is as follows:

<blockquote>
Many 3D feature descriptors have been developed
over the years to solve problems that require the representation
of object shape, e. g. object recognition or pose estimation, but
comparatively few have been developed specifically to tackle
the problem of object affordance learning, a domain where
the interaction between action parameters and sensory features
play a crucial role. In previous work, we introduced a feature
descriptor that divided an object point cloud into coarse-
grained cells, derived simple features from each of the cells,
and grounded those features with respect to a reference frame
defined by a pushing action. We also compared this action-grounded
descriptor to an equivalent non-action-grounded
descriptor coupled with action features in a push affordance
classification task and established that the action-grounded
encoding can provide improved performance. In this paper, we
investigate modifying more well-established 3D shape descriptors
based on surface geometry, in particular the Viewpoint
Feature Histogram (VFH), such that they are action-grounded
in a similar manner, compare them to volumetric octree-based
representations, and conclude that having multi-scaled
representations in which parts at each scale can be referenced
with respect to each other may be a crucial component in
action-grounded affordance learning.
