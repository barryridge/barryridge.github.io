				<title>Arrival</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am launching my new website and blog.
I hope to make this endeavour be about more than just solidifying my ‘online presence’.
Writing regularly is important for a working academic and it can help to serve a number of functions.
Dissemination is of course the most obvious one, but what about motivation?
I think that by placing an onus upon oneself to write something regularly via a public blog,
a type of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback&quot;&gt;positive feedback loop&lt;/a&gt; can be engendered
that (hopefully!) results in getting more actual work done, owing to the need to actually have something
to write about, that in turn results in writing more in order to report on the work that
was done, that in turn results in doing more work in order to have something more to write about,
and so on ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;
